              The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup
              language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
              It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
              (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br />Web
              browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
              storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
              describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
              included cues for the appearance of the document.<br />HTML can
              embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
              which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of
              CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br />
              The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
              and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
              use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
              describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
              language such as HTML.<br />
              CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
              HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of
              presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
              <br />This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
              more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
              characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
              specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
              complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
              enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
              between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br />
              In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
              including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

              JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
              that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
              high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
              has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
              object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and
              CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
              Web.<br />
              Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
              often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have
              a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's
              device. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
              event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br />
              It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with
              text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
              the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
              include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
              graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime
              system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br />JavaScript engines
              were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core
              components of other software systems, most notably servers and a
              variety of applications. Although there are similarities between
              JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
              respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
              differ greatly in design.
